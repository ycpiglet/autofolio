# UNIT-EXAMPLE-001 - Worker-Ready Unit Example

## Context

This example shows the fields a planner must fill before assigning a unit to a
worker model.

## Inputs

- `agents/project/PROJECT-CONTEXT.yml`

## Target Files

- `scripts/example.py`

## Scope

In scope: one precise, reversible implementation unit.

Out of scope: adjacent tasksets, unrelated refactors, and external mutation.

## Steps

1. Read the linked task and project context.
2. Edit only the target files.
3. Run the listed verification.
4. Stop and report.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The unit can be executed from this file alone.

## Verification

```powershell
python scripts/task_unit_readiness_gate.py --task-id TASK-EXAMPLE --check
```

## Handoff

Report changed files, verification output, and unresolved blockers.

## Stop Boundary

Stop after this unit. Do not continue into adjacent tasksets.

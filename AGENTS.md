# AGENTS.md

Shared operating protocol for Codex, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, and other agents
working in this repository.

This file is the repository-level source of truth. Tool-specific files such as
`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CURSOR.md` may add local guidance, but when they
conflict, follow this file and the latest records under `agents/lead_engineer/`.

## 0. Core Rules

1. Read the same starting context before doing non-trivial work.
2. Do not start implementation without an explicit user request or an approved
   `CYCLE` / `TASK` record.
3. Do not create duplicate work. Search existing tasks and backlog first.
4. Keep changes small, scoped, and verifiable.
5. A task is not complete until the result and verification are recorded.
6. Do not guess timestamps. Use `python scripts/now.py`.
7. Never commit secrets, credentials, private runtime state, or local tool data.

## 1. Start Protocol

Before non-trivial work, read:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `agents/project/PROJECT-CONTEXT.yml` if present
4. `AGENT_RUNTIME.md`
5. `agents/lead_engineer/STATUS.md`
6. `agents/lead_engineer/AUDIT-LOG.md`
7. `agents/roles.yml`
8. Tool-specific guidance, if relevant
9. Your role file: `agents/{role}/SKILL.md`
10. `agents/lead_engineer/tasks/BACKLOG.md`
11. The latest relevant `CYCLE`, `REVIEW`, and `TASK` files

Create an internal context snapshot:

```text
latest cycle:
current request:
related task:
role:
owner:
scope:
out of scope:
done when:
verification:
```

Only print the snapshot when it would clarify ambiguity or risk.

## 2. Source Of Truth

| Topic | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Project overview and setup | `README.md` |
| Host project context | `agents/project/PROJECT-CONTEXT.yml` and `agents/project/*.md` |
| Shared agent protocol | `AGENTS.md` |
| Current operating status | `agents/lead_engineer/STATUS.md` |
| Decisions and operating changes | `agents/lead_engineer/AUDIT-LOG.md` |
| Role registry | `agents/roles.yml` |
| Open work board | `agents/lead_engineer/tasks/BACKLOG.md` |
| Task registry | `agents/lead_engineer/tasks/INDEX.md` |
| Individual tasks | `agents/lead_engineer/tasks/TASK-*.md` |
| Reports | `agents/lead_engineer/reports/` |
| Runtime model | `AGENT_RUNTIME.md` |

Do not hard-code the current cycle number in tool-specific documents. Determine
the latest cycle from the files in `agents/lead_engineer/`.

## 3. Project Context Overlay

Reusable runtime skills stay generic. Host-specific product identity, MVP
scope, vision, roadmap, organization, and external references live under
`agents/project/`.

When adapting this runtime to a new project:

1. Copy `agents/project/PROJECT-CONTEXT.example.yml` to
   `agents/project/PROJECT-CONTEXT.yml`.
2. Fill product-specific files such as `VISION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ORG.md`,
   `TEAMS.md`, and `LINKS.md`.
3. Reference those files from TASK records and context packets.
4. Do not edit `agents/*/SKILL.md` or `scripts/*` to encode project-specific
   product behavior.

If a role needs project-specific nuance, add a host-owned note under
`agents/project/` and link it from the task. Promote it upstream only when it is
generic across projects.

## 4. Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Owner | Human final authority for irreversible, external, destructive, or high-risk changes |
| CEO | Autonomous coordinator for routine goals, scope, priority, cost, and risk |
| Managing Partner | Independent cost, direction, and role-balance review |
| Lead Engineer | Plan, task definition, assignment, review, and closure records |
| Independent Auditor | Evidence, completion, cost, and self-review audit |
| Doc Steward | Documentation freshness, integrity, stale references, and missing artifacts |
| Scribe | Cleanup, compression, normalization, and archive notes after canonical state is set |
| Research Agent | Evidence notes from official docs, standards, or external examples |
| Timeline Agent | Chronology reconstruction across tasks, meetings, audits, and messages |
| Requirements Interviewer | Clarifies ambiguous requests before plan or implementation |
| Secretary | Personal desk summary, reminders, agenda prep, and non-governance assistance |
| Backend Engineer | Server, data, auth, and API surfaces for the host project |
| UI/UX Designer | Frontend, accessibility, responsive behavior, and user workflows |
| CI/CD Engineer | Git, PR, release, deployment, and environment workflows |
| QA | Tests, regression checks, bug reports, and quality gates |
| Beta Tester | User-perspective exploration and scenario reports |

One task has one accountable owner. Collaborators may contribute, but the owner
closes the record.

## 5. Work Selection

When a request arrives:

1. Check whether an existing `TASK`, bug, or test case already covers it.
2. If yes, continue that record instead of creating a duplicate.
3. If it is inside the current cycle, work under that cycle.
4. If it is a direct user request outside the current cycle, keep it small and
   record it.
5. If the request changes architecture, workflow, public release, secrets, data,
   or irreversible state, escalate before mutation.

Allowed task states:

- `대기`
- `진행 중`
- `완료`
- `보류`

## 6. Reversibility Gate

Use reversibility and blast radius to decide whether to act or ask.

| Level | Rule |
|-------|------|
| R1 | Reversible and in scope: act, verify, record |
| R2 | Reversible but slightly ambiguous or cross-scope: act, flag assumptions and undo path |
| R3 | Irreversible, destructive, external, secret-bearing, production-data, or high-risk: ask Owner |

### Autonomous Delivery Lane

Branch, commit, PR, and merge work should be automated by default when the
repository has deterministic gates and the change is not critical.

| Step | Default | Required evidence |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Branch | Agent may create a scoped task branch | task id, scope, rollback path |
| Commit | Agent may commit scoped changes | focused check result and changed-file summary |
| PR | Agent may open/update PR | review summary, test evidence, risk label |
| Merge | Agent may merge when configured gates pass | green checks, no critical findings, merge log |

Owner approval is not required for routine branch/commit/PR/merge execution
when all of these are true:

1. the change is scoped to an approved task or direct user request;
2. no secret, production data, billing, legal, destructive, or public release
   boundary is crossed;
3. required checks pass or a documented waiver is approved by the accountable
   non-Owner role named in the task;
4. the merge target and branch protection rules permit automation;
5. rollback is possible through normal VCS history.

Examples that require Owner approval:

- file or directory deletion
- recursive move or delete
- force push, rollback, hard reset, or checkout that discards work
- production deployment or external publication
- secret access or rotation
- production data writes
- disabling safety checks
- critical security, legal, billing, data-loss, or irreversible release changes

If the execution platform asks for permission, do not bypass it. Present the
smallest safe command scope.

## 7. File Edits

1. Check the worktree before edits.
2. Preserve user changes.
3. Edit only files tied to the current task.
4. Keep generated, local, runtime, and secret files out of public release.
5. Use structured parsers or existing scripts where available.
6. If behavior changes, update the relevant docs and verification records.

## 8. Records

New task records should include:

```yaml
---
type: task
id: TASK-NNN
status: 대기
owner: Lead Engineer
assignees: [Lead Engineer]
priority: Medium
difficulty: 중
est_hours: 1
est_tokens: 10000
tags: [automation]
trigger_meeting: 자가발생
audit_log: AUDIT-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN
created: YYYY-MM-DD
created_at: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+09:00
---
```

Completion records must state:

- original request
- actual work performed
- result
- changed files
- verification commands and outcomes
- remaining issues or handoff notes

## 9. Reporting

Final task reports use the human-centered, machine-readable Executive BRIEF
format. Keep it concise, visually scannable, and action-oriented.

```yaml
---
type: brief
id: BRIEF-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN
audience: owner|ceo|agent-team
status: G|Y|R
priority: Critical|High|Medium|Low
tags: [release, automation]
actions: [approve, review, no-action]
evidence:
  - path/or/url
---
```

```text
Bottom Line: <one-line outcome and decision>.

## Signal
| Item | State | Evidence |
|------|-------|----------|
| Work | G/Y/R | <evidence> |

## Insight
1. <short interpretation>

## Decision
1. <decision needed, or "없음">

## Next
| Step | Owner | Trigger |
|------|-------|---------|
| <action> | <role> | <condition> |
```

Use `G`, `Y`, and `R` for state. Do not use emoji.

## 10. Time

Use these commands for timestamps:

```powershell
python scripts/now.py
python scripts/now.py --utc
python scripts/now.py --date
```

If Python is unavailable, mark time as `unknown` rather than guessing.

## 11. Git

Default flow is automated unless a critical boundary is detected:

1. Create a task branch.
2. Make small scoped commits.
3. Run focused checks.
4. Open or update a PR.
5. Dispatch review agents or CI checks.
6. Merge through the configured gate when checks pass.
7. Record branch, commit, PR, merge, and evidence links.

Do not push directly to `main` unless this repository explicitly allows it.
Do not ask Owner for routine branch/commit/PR/merge approval when the
Autonomous Delivery Lane conditions are met.

## 11.5 Release Council

Routine patch/minor releases may be decided by an agent release council instead
of Owner approval when all release gates pass and no critical boundary exists.

Required council roles:

1. Lead Engineer: scope and version readiness.
2. QA: validation evidence.
3. Independent Auditor: risk and evidence integrity.
4. Doc Steward: changelog, reports, and handoff quality.

Owner approval is required only for critical releases:

1. major version or breaking change;
2. secret, credential, production data, billing, or legal impact;
3. failed, missing, or waived critical gate;
4. external publication to a new or untrusted target;
5. destructive rollback, force push, or irreversible operation;
6. explicit user or organization policy requiring Owner sign-off.

## 12. Agent Runtime Sync

This repository may consume reusable automation through `agent_runtime`.
Host projects pin the upstream in `agent_runtime.yml` and update through:

```powershell
agent_runtime update-plan --root . --check
agent_runtime update --root . --check
agent_runtime update --root . --diff
agent_runtime update --root . --apply
agent_runtime lock --root . --write
```

The update path must preserve host edits and only apply managed template files.

## 13. Validation

Before closure, run the narrowest useful checks first, then the repository gate:

```powershell
python scripts/check_agent_docs.py
```

If a check cannot run, report exactly why and what remains unverified.

## 14. Handoff Protocol

다른 모델/세션으로 인계할 때는 4섹션으로 남긴다: (1) 한 일·검증, (2) 열린 작업·블로커, (3) 봐야 할 파일·문서·TASK, (4) 주의/리스크.

## 15. Token Budget

세션 토큰 카탈로그·예산 규약은 [agents/lead_engineer/TOKEN-BUDGET.md](agents/lead_engineer/TOKEN-BUDGET.md)를 따른다. 대형 작업 전 예상 비용을 BRIEF/PLAN의 Cost에 기재한다.

## 16. Autofolio R3 Surface (Autonomous Delivery Lane 보정)

§6 Autonomous Delivery Lane의 "critical boundary" 를 Autofolio 고유 surface로 구체화한다. 아래가 하나라도 포함되면 Owner 에스컬레이션:

- `.env`, KIS 앱키·계좌(`KIS_*`), 시크릿
- `app/brokers/kis/` 실주문 경로(`place_order`/`cancel_order`), `app/engine/order_flow.py`, `app/risk/**` 안전 게이트 변경
- DB 스키마·마이그레이션(`app/database/schema.sql`, `*migrate*`)
- 자동 실매매 ON 전환·킬스위치 무력화 등 안전 정책 변경(MVP_SPEC §10)
- `.github/workflows/**` CI 변경

코드 정본: `scripts/auto_merge.py`.

## 17. Upstream Bug Reporting (강제 규칙)

에러·버그·이슈 발생 시 **반드시** 다음 절차를 따른다.

### 분류 (is_upstream_bug)

아래 중 하나라도 해당하면 upstream(agent_runtime) 버그다:
- 스택트레이스에 `site-packages/agent_runtime` 경로 포함
- `agent_runtime.sync`, `agent_runtime.config` 등 upstream 모듈 에러
- EVIDENCE의 `scope`에 `agent_runtime upstream` 포함

그 외는 Autofolio 로컬 버그.

### 보고 의무 (육하원칙 + BRIEF)

| 항목 | 로컬 버그 | upstream 버그 |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| EVIDENCE 파일 작성 | 필수 (EVIDENCE-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN) | 필수 |
| 육하원칙(6W1H) | 필수 | 필수 |
| AUDIT-LOG 기록 | 필수 | 필수 |
| GitHub Issue | 선택 | **72h 내 필수** |
| GitHub PR (패치) | 해당 시 | 가능하면 동반 |
| 보고 도구 | — | `scripts/report_upstream_bug.py` |

### 자동 분류 + 보고

```powershell
# EVIDENCE 작성 후 자동 분류·Issue 생성
python scripts/report_upstream_bug.py --evidence EVIDENCE-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-xxx.md
# dry-run으로 내용 미리보기
python scripts/report_upstream_bug.py --evidence EVIDENCE-*.md --dry-run
```

### SessionStart 경고

`.remember/now.md` 또는 AUDIT-LOG에 미보고 upstream 버그가 있으면 세션 시작 시 경고한다.
`scripts/check_upstream_issues.py --warn`으로 확인.

### 양방향 강제

이 규칙은 **Autofolio와 agent_runtime 양쪽에 적용**된다:
- Autofolio: 이 §17 + `scripts/report_upstream_bug.py`
- agent_runtime: upstream PR을 통해 `AGENTS.md §N Downstream Bug Intake` 추가 요청
  (Autofolio가 발견한 버그를 upstream이 체계적으로 수신·처리하도록)
